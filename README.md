#AstronomyAppService 

This is the back-end service for the Astronomy Application. 
As of now, the service contains endpoints for managing a catalog list of astronomy objects (ie: NGC 1976--Orion Nebula and NGC 3031--Bode's Galaxy). 
In the future, the service may expand to perform other functions. We'll see! 

Current features I would like to work on at time of writing: 
1. Write unit tests for this service. 
2. Research which database to use for the service. Right now, the service uses SQL Server. But, I may switch to other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL. 
3. Create Dockerfile to package the service. 
4. Create docker-compose file to start up the service and database.
